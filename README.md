## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) (for deployment)
- [Google Books API Key](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marwan-Taha/BookScribe.git
cd BookScribe
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_books_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

### Initialize the Database

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL instance (using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) or directly via CLI).
2. Create a new database (e.g., `BookScribe`).
3. Run the SQL schema commands to create tables:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE books (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     google_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     title VARCHAR(255)
   );

   CREATE TABLE user_books (
     user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
     book_id INT REFERENCES books(id),
     PRIMARY KEY (user_id, book_id)
   );

   CREATE TABLE notes (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
     book_id INT REFERENCES books(id),
     content TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

### Run the Application Locally

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. Visit the homepage to search for books.
2. Add books to your personal library.
3. View details for each book and add notes.
4. Access your dashboard to view and manage your library and notes.


## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication.
- Add categories and tagging for books.
- Enhance search and filtering capabilities.
- Implement a reminder system for reading goals.
